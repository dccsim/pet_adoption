# pet_adoption
Experimenting with machine learning models that attempts to predict pet adoption speeds

This repository contains the scripts and data sets for [Professional Certificate in Data Science learning programme by HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)

The final Course Capstone (PH125.9x) requires the student to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression. The student will have the opportunity to use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of choice. 

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists.

Data set can be selected from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html). 

File contents:
* The R script file contain the codes used for data exploration, visualisation and building the prediction models
* The Rmd file contains the codes to generate the PDF report that describes the process and outcome of the development of models that predict pet adoption speeds
* The R object files (.rds) contain models that will be loaded by the Rmd script to generate the PDF report
